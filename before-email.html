<li>Inquiries about research for undergrads and MS students at UCSD:

First, you need to have taken/audited my classes (150B or 257) and did well in it, just so that we have a common language. Then if you are interested in research, send me a 2-page description of what you are interested in, what you want to do, and why you think you are prepared for doing it. Cite papers. Write in Latex. If what you wrote sounds interesting I'll discuss with you and try helping you. Apart from that I do not have "research opportunities" that can make you part of any large student teams.

<li>Inquiries about recommendation letters:

Due to the extremely large number of students I teach every year, I no longer write letters for general MS program application for anyone. I can write two types of letters: for PhD programs and the UCSD MS/BS program. For PhD you must have worked with me closely for some amount of time (it's unlilkely that anyone who has done that needs to email me in the first place). For MS/BS at UCSD, you need to have been among the top 2% in my class (total raw score in the class) or have worked with me as a tutor. 

<li>PhD applications:

Send applications through UCSD application systems and feel free to email me a detailed description of what you want to work on and why you want to work with me. Simply copy-pasting a paper abstract will have negative effects. 

<li>Postdocs and Research Scholars:

Make sure there's something we are both interested in.
