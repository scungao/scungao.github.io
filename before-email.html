<li>Inquiries about recommendation letters:

Due to the very large number of students I teach every year, I no longer write letters for general MS program application for anyone. I can write two types of letters: for PhD programs and the UCSD MS/BS program. For PhD you must have worked with me closely for some amount of time (it's unlilkely that anyone who has done that needs to email me in the first place). For MS/BS at UCSD, you need to have been among the top 2% in my class (total raw score in the class) or have worked with me as a tutor. 

<li>PhD applications:

Send applications through UCSD application systems and feel free to email me a detailed description of what you want to work on and why you want to work with me. Simply copy-pasting a paper abstract will have negative effects. 

<li>Postdocs and Research Scholars:

Make sure there's something we are both interested in.
