<b>Description</b>
<hr width="50" align="LEFT">
Automated reasoning (AR) is an area of AI that studies how to develop computational systems that can perform logical reasoning. The course will first cover the basics of propositional and first-order logic, and then focus on core reasoning algorithms and their connections to standard AI techniques, including search, learning, planning, and optimization.
