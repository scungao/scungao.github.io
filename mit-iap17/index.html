<b>Description</b>
<hr width="50" align="LEFT">
Automated reasoning is an area of AI that studies algorithmic approaches to logical reasoning, and problem-solving in general. It is the oldest branch and also the next frontier of AI, thanks to tremendous progress in recent decades. The course will first cover the basics of propositional and first-order logic, and then focus on core reasoning algorithms and their connections to standard topics in AI, including search, learning, planning, and optimization. There will be an invited lecture by experts from the Toyota Research Institute on how automated reasoning systems are used to tackle bottleneck problems in safe automnomous driving.

Students will be required to turn in 6-page reports for their course projects (in AAAI/IJCAI paper formats). The goal is to guide students to find interesting research topics and initiate some publishable line of work. No final exam.
