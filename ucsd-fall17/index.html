<b>Description</b>
<hr width="50" align="LEFT">
Automated reasoning is an area of AI that studies algorithmic approaches to logical reasoning, and (NP-hard) problem solving in general. It is arguably the oldest topic of AI and also a next frontier, thanks to tremendous progress in recent decades. The course will cover the basics of propositional and first-order logic, core SAT solving and constraint solving algorithms, and their connections to major topics in AI such as search, planning, and learning. Students will learn how to build SAT solvers from scratch.
