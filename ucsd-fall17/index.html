<b>Description</b>
<hr width="50" align="LEFT">
Automated reasoning is an area of AI that studies algorithmic approaches to logical reasoning, and problem solving in general. It is arguably the oldest topic of AI and also its next frontier, thanks to tremendous progress in recent decades. The course will cover the basics of propositional and first-order logic, core SAT solving and constraint solving algorithms, and their connections to major topics in AI, including search, planning, and learning. Students will learn how build SAT solvers from scratch.
